# Crossplane Provider for Cloud Foundry

## About this project

`crossplane-provider-cloudfoundry` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider for [Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/). The provider that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

- Custom Resource Definitions ([CRDs](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/SAP/crossplane-provider-cloudfoundry)) that model Cloud Foundry resources (e.g. [Organization, Space, Services, Applications, etc.](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/SAP/crossplane-provider-cloudfoundry))
- Custom Controllers to provision these resources in a Cloud Foundry deployment based on the users desired state captured in [CRDs](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/SAP/crossplane-provider-cloudfoundry) they create

## Roadmap
We have a lot of exciting new features and improvements in our backlogs for you to expect and even contribute yourself! We will publish a detailed roadmap soon.

## 📊 Installation

> **This fork uses crossplane-runtime v2 with namespace-scoped CRDs.**
> All managed resources, ProviderConfigs, and ProviderConfigUsages are namespace-scoped.
> This is a **breaking change** — existing cluster-scoped CRs must be recreated as namespaced resources.

To install this provider in a kubernetes cluster running crossplane, you can use the provider custom resource, replacing the `<VERSION>` placeholder with the current version of this provider (e.g. v0.3.0):

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-cloudfoundry
spec:
  package: ghcr.io/sap/crossplane-provider-cloudfoundry/crossplane/provider-cloudfoundry:<VERSION>
```

Crossplane will take care to create a deployment for this provider. Once it becomes healthy, you can configure your provider using proper credentials and start orchestrating :rocket:.

### Namespace-scoped Resources

All CRDs in this provider are **namespace-scoped**. This means:

- Every managed resource (Organization, Space, ServiceInstance, etc.) must include a `metadata.namespace`
- The `ProviderConfig` must be in the **same namespace** as the managed resources referencing it
- Cross-references between resources (e.g. Space → Organization) must be within the **same namespace**

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: cloudfoundry.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: my-team
spec:
  apiEndpoint: https://api.cf.example.com
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      name: cf-credentials
      namespace: my-team
      key: credentials
---
apiVersion: cloudfoundry.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: Space
metadata:
  name: my-space
  namespace: my-team
spec:
  forProvider:
    name: my-space
    orgRef:
      name: my-org
```

## 🔬 Developing
### Initial Setup
The provider comes with some tooling to ease a local setup for development. As initial setup you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make submodules` to initialize the "build" submodule provided by crossplane
3. Run `make dev-debug` to create a kind cluster and install the CRDs

:warning: Please note that you are required to have [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed on your local machine in order to run dev debug.

Those steps will leave you with a local cluster and your KUBECONFIG being configured to connect to it via e.g. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) or [k9s](https://k9scli.io). You can already apply manifests to that cluster at this point.

### Running the Controller
To run the controller locally, you can use the following command:
```bash
make run
```
This will compile your controller as executable and run it locally (outside of your cluster).
It will connect to your cluster using your KUBECONFIG configuration and start watching for resources.

### Cleaning up
For deleting the cluster again, run
```bash
make dev-clean
```

### E2E Tests
The provider comes with a set of end-to-end tests that can be run locally. To run them, you can use the following command:
```bash
make test-acceptance
```
This will spin up a specific kind cluster which runs the provider as docker container in it. The e2e tests will run kubectl commands against that cluster to test the provider's functionality.

Please note that when running multiple times you might want to delete the kind cluster again to avoid conflicts:
```bash
kind delete cluster <cluster-name>
```

### Upgrade Tests

The provider comes with a set of upgrade tests that can be run locally. To learn more about it : [Upgrade Tests README](./test/upgrade/README.md).

#### Required Configuration
In order for the tests to perform successfully some configuration need to be present as environment variables:

**CF_CREDENTIALS**

User credentials for a user that is Cloud Foundry Administrator in the configured environment, structure:
```json
{
  "email": "email",
  "username": "PuserId",
  "password": "mypass"
}
```

**CF_ENVIRONMENT**

Contains the CF server URL, for example:
```
https://api.cf.eu12.hana.ondemand.com
```

## Export CLI

The provider includes an export CLI tool that generates managed resource definitions from the existing resource configurations of a Cloud Foundry cluster.

For more details, refer to the [user guide](cmd/exporter/docs/USERGUIDE.md).
