                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223
